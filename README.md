# hello-world
my first repository
Hello my name is Houston and I live in the southern California area. I am currently a self taught developer. I am studying and learning how to code using modern JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, Django, SQL and AWS. I am currently looking to work on projects and with companies as an intern if needed to gain more experience in the industry. I am happily married and we are big Disney fans. I love to be out doors whenever possible. Hiking, hunting and training is what I like to do when I'm not inside!
